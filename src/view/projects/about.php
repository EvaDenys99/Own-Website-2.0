  <h2>Development. Design. Experience.</h2>
  <img src="" alt="">
  <p>Those are my three keywords.</p>
  <p>Initially I have a background in <span> ICT & Engineering</span>. This is where my passion for developing began and although building robots is fun, developing websites is even better. </p>
  <p>But why those three keywords, you might ask?
  Let’s start with <span>development</span>. Making sure your idea is realized and let the static design come to life is my main goal. As a web developer, I’m at ease with a lot of coding languages to do exactly that.
  Besides being a developer, I also appreciate a good-looking <span> design</span>. This is why I’m a designer on the side to make sure your site is a delight to the eye.
  Last but not least: <span>experience</span>. Making sure you and your audience have the experience they want and expect is essential in both developing and designing a website.</p>
  <p>If interested, you can always check out <span> my resume </span> or you can always contact me directly <span> evadenys@hotmail.com </span>. </p>
